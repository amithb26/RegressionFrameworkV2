Steps to setup the framework and execute the robot testcase.


STEP 1> In order to run the testcases some pre requisite services should be installed on the host machine.
This is performed by the 'install.sh' file under the folder run/
Command:
<change directory to run>/$sh install.sh


STEP 2> If the testbed is a Docker setup, you need to execute 'dockertool.py' file. This python program takes
one argument i.e., the absolute path to the testbed file (testbed_docker.json). It will spawn the dockers
and establish connection between them according to the details in the testbed file. This file is under 
run/dockeretup folder.
Command:
<change directory to dockersetup>/$ python dockertool.py /absolute/path/to/testbed/file/testbed_Docker.json


STEP 3> Now that the pre requisites are done, in order to execute robot testcase file, we need to run the 'test.sh'
file. This file is in run folder. This file takes two arguments, one is the absolute path to the testbed file and 
absolute path to the robot testcase file.
Command:
<change directory to run>/$sh test.sh /absolute/path/to/testbed/file/testbed_Docker.json /path/to/testCases/usecase/TestSuite.robot
